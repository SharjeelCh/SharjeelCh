# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sharjeel Fida

I'm a **React Native Android developer** and **MERN stack enthusiast** who loves turning ideas into real-world apps. Whether it’s a sleek mobile app using React Native or a full-stack web application with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js—I'm all about clean code and great user experience.

---

## 🔧 What I Do

- 🚀 Build cross-platform mobile apps (React Native + Expo)
- 🌐 Develop full-stack web apps (MERN + Firebase)
- 🛠️ Tinker with backend APIs and real-time systems (Socket.io, Node.js)
- 🧠 Keep learning... always.

## 💡 Fun Fact

> I once debugged an app for 3 hours before realizing the issue was a missing semicolon. Never again (hopefully).
